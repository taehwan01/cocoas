# cocoas README

Copy codes as wanted.

I first made this extension since when I request someone a feedback for my code, or ask something on Internet or ChatGPT, I always needed the file path.

Therefore, I got this extension for those to easily copy the path with the code.

And will update features with more options of how to copy codes.

## Features

### Command keys

> Windows/Linux: `ctrl + shift + c + f`

> Mac: `cmd + shift + c + f`
